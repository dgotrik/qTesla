# Lattice-based digital signature scheme **qTESLA**

This project is a part of submission of the lattice-based digital signature
scheme qTesla to the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization
project, 2017. Full specification can be found in submission's
[website](qtesla.org).

## Contents

- [`KAT`](KAT/)                     : Contains the Known Answer Tests
- [`Reference_Implementation`](Reference_Implementation) : Contains the reference implementation

## Contents of subfolders

### Subfolder `KAT`:
This folder contains knowns answer tests results for the proposed parameter sets.

- `PQCsignKAT_qTesla-I.rsp` : Known answer test results for qTesla-I
- `PQCsignKAT_qTesla-III-size.rsp` : Known answer test results for qTesla-III-size
- `PQCsignKAT_qTesla-III-speed.rsp` : Known answer test results for qTesla-III-speed
- `PQCsignKAT_qTesla-p-I.rsp`: Known answer test results for qTesla-p-I
- `PQCsignKAT_qTesla-p-III.rsp` : Known answer test results for qTesla-p-III

### Subfolder `Reference_Implementation`:
This folder contains four subfolders which contain the reference implementations
for the proposed parameter sets.

- "qTesla-I" : Reference implementation of qTesla-I with parameters for
               NIST’s security category 1
- "qTesla-III-size" : Reference implementation of qTesla-III-size with parameters for
               NIST’s security category 3
- "qTesla-III-speed" : Reference implementation of qTesla-III-speed with parameters for
               NIST’s security category 3
- "qTesla-p-I" : Reference implementation of qTesla-p-I with parameters for
               NIST’s security category 1
- "qTesla-p-III" : Reference implementation of qTesla-p-III with parameters for
               NIST’s security category 3

## Instructions for linux

Each directory has own makefiles, and can be compiled by executing

```sh
$ make
```

Codes will be compiled using gcc. Testing and benchmarking results can be seen
with running following command.

```sh
$ ./test_qtesla
```

This outputs key and signature sizes, acceptance probabilities during key
generation and signing, and lastly cycle counts for key generation, signing,
and verification.


KAT files can be generated by executing:

```sh
./PQCgenKAT_sign
```

Pre-computed KAT values can be tested against the code by executing:

```sh
./PQCtestKAT_sign
```
